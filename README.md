# Deep-Learning-NN
After reading the book [Deep Learning Illustrated](https://www.deeplearningillustrated.com/), I wanted to experiment in making CNN's, NN's, and using transfer learning to make predictive models based on the tensorflow flowers dataset and the fashion mnist data set. 

The following models were created:
| Model                  | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| FMNIST Dense Layer NN  | 87.1%    |
| FMNIST CNN             | 92.6%   |
| Tensorflow Flowers CNN | 63.9%    |
| Tensorflow Flowers Transfer Learning | 81.6%   |
